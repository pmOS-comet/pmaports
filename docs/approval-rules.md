# pmaports Approval Rules

pmaports follows the general
[code review and merge](https://docs.postmarketos.org/policies-and-processes/development/code-review-and-merge.html)
rules, but with the following changes.

## Regular MR approvals

Most MRs, those not considered critical or trivial require approval by the
package maintainer, and by another team member with approval and merge
rights. If there is no package maintainer or the package maintainer does not
reply within 2 weeks from the time the MR was opened, then any 2 approvals are
required.

## Move device from category

Moving devices from category is a special operation, see
[device categorization](./device-categorization).

## Changing kconfigcheck requirements

Changes to `kconfigcheck.toml` are a special operation, see
[kconfigcheck](./kconfigcheck).

## Testing requirements

Some MRs require testing due to changes affecting multiple devices. In such
cases, before merging, in addition to the regular approvals, it is required to:

* **edge**: any person in a MR thread confirms that a MR works.
* **stable**: one person from the team confirms that a MR works. On
  device-specific MRs that the team can't test, instead require confirmation of
  device maintainer that it works.

## Backporting

Backporting features from edge to stable is done at request of the MR author or
package maintainer. All patches for stable branches must go through edge first
and get backported from there to get additional testing before they potentially
breaks something in stable, and should be tested in the MR too. The only
exception are patches for failures that only happen on stable.

While backporting patches to stable, label the MR with the corresponding
`backport-to-v*` label, and cherry-pick the commits with the `-x` option, to
make sure that the original commit is mentioned.
