Subject: [PATCH 03/12] libcamera: simple: Enable softISP for the Pinephone

In theory the PP should be able to use the actual HW ISP, however in
practice this does not work well yet - especially as the driver for the
front camera in Megi differs heavily from the upstream one.

Thus enable the swISP to make both cameras work reliably for now. This
is essentially what Megapixels does as well. If the HW ISP situation
improves, this can be dropped again.
